Ansible Role: Update
====================

An Ansible role to update system packages and to reboot the system if required.

Supported Linux Distributions
-----------------------------

The policy of this role is to support Linux distributions while they are
supported with public updates. Once a distribution's official public support
period ends, this role will no longer support the distribution.

| CentOS Stream | 10 years       | 8, 9                |
| Debian        | 5 years        | 10, 11              |
| Fedora        | 1 year         | 36, 37              |
| Oracle Linux  | 10 years       | 8, 9                |
| Rocky Linux   | 10 years       | 8, 9                |
